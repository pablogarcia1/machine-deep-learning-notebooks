# Coffee Image Classification with CNN

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using TensorFlow/Keras to classify coffee-related images.  
The dataset used is self-created and very small, which means the model is heavily biased due to limited training data.  
However, with the images included in this repository, you can train, test, and validate a functional model given the available information.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Training set**: 39 images  
- **Test set**: 12 images  
- Images are stored in folders (`training_set` and `test_set`) and are automatically labeled by `ImageDataGenerator`.  

Because of the dataset size, the model is not generalizable, but it still demonstrates the full workflow of:
- Data preprocessing  
- CNN training  
- Model saving/loading  
- Image prediction

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of training, validating, saving, and testing a CNN with TensorFlow/Keras. Even with a very small dataset, it provides a functional pipeline that can be adapted to larger and more realistic datasets.
